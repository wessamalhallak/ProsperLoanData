#Scatter matrix and first overview
Here we will make an overview for all variable together then 
we will try to explore variables as univariable to know some information about
the chartatsitic for each variable , later on we will try to explore some information
about the realtion between each two variables and then we try to get in depth between more
than two variables in mulitvariable section finally I will reflect my conclusinios in 
the last section #conclusion

# Univariate Analysis


we can see alot of information from the previos section,
some propierts was expected others was a little superising 

examples : 
It was expected to get some pattern in loan value to tend to get some 
pattern (1000 , 5000 , 10000, 15000 )
personally I was expecte a equal distrupitoin in loan Term, 
nevertheless it was manily in 36 monthes 
the in come range for the borrower is normally distrupited as expected
the most interesting thing was the mode in monthly loan payment 
around 175 $ I think there is some requlation 
in united state reinforce  this amount of monthly payment.
something unexpect also the drop in the entreing date between 
2009 and 2010 I think this because of integration into
new system

# Multivariate Analysis
we can see the pattern in between montly loan payment , borrower rate and the proposer rate.

# Final Plots and Summary.

### Plot One
```{r}

RawData %>%
  filter(Occupation!="Other" )%>%
  filter(Occupation!="Professional" )%>%
  filter(Occupation!="")%>%
  count(Occupation) %>% 
  mutate(Occupation=reorder(Occupation,-n))%>% 
  filter(n>quantile(n,0.70))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Occupation, y = n,fill=sqrt(n)))+
    geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
    #scale_fill_viridis(option = "D")+
    theme_minimal()+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle= 60, hjust=1))+
    labs(title="Occupation ", x="Occupation", y="Count",fill="Sqrt(Count)")
```

this plot describe what is the distruption of loans count regarding 
the profession after discared the misinformative occpuation like (other, profession)
so we can suggest wich field of worker in the next campigns to target to get
some more sales 




### Plot Two
```{r}

RawData%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ListingCreationDate,fill=as.factor(Term)))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.6)+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2",direction = 1)+
  labs(title="Term ",
       subtitle="The length of the loan expressed in months.",
       x="Listing Creation Date",
       y="Density",
       fill="CreditGrade")


```

In this plot we can answer our quesiotn in univaraible examination 
which was a little bit surprising why the 36 is the most likable loan
we can see that other types are only started after 2009 ( maybe of reugaltion)
also the other type of loan ( 12 ) is no available any more inspite of
it was very popular I think there's  a good markt opprtuinity in prompt again
this type of Loan



### Plot LoanOriginalAmount	vs MonthlyLoanPayment	, Term
```{r}

RawData%>%
  filter(MonthlyLoanPayment>quantile(MonthlyLoanPayment,0.01))%>%
  filter(MonthlyLoanPayment<quantile(MonthlyLoanPayment,0.99))%>%
  filter(LoanOriginalAmount!=0)%>%
  ggplot(aes(y=LoanOriginalAmount,x=MonthlyLoanPayment,color=as.factor(Term)))+
      geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
      scale_color_viridis_d(option="D")+
      scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "D",direction = -1)+
      #coord_trans(y="sqrt")+
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=6, angle=90,hjust = 1))+
      labs(title="Occupation, Employment status, and loan orignal ammont", 
           x="Monthly Loan Payment",
           y="Loan Original Amount",
           color="Term in Monthes")

```


In the preivous plot we can easly see the relation between the three variabls and the lineartiy is obvious

# Reflection
we have explored myn variabls  and this data set is really very informative,
I wish i had the time to dig more and explore an extra ready variblas or 
calculated supported ones espeically the last plot descripe the realtion between the variables
